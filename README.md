# C4 Reader and Converter to PDF

Convert legacy C4/JEDMICS engineering raster drawings to PDF.

This project now has two ways to use it:

1. **Online one file converter** through GitHub Pages.
2. **Local Windows Python dashboard** for previewing, saving, and batch converting folders.

## Online converter

The online converter is up and running here:

[https://deerspotter.github.io/C4-Reader-and-Converter-to-pdf/](https://deerspotter.github.io/C4-Reader-and-Converter-to-pdf/)

Use this when you only need to convert one `.C4` or `.MIL` file at a time.

The browser version runs locally in your browser. The selected file is not uploaded to a server. It reads the C4/JEDMICS tile data, builds a PDF in the browser, and lets you open or download the generated PDF.

Online converter features:

- Select or drag and drop one `.C4` or `.MIL` file.
- Preview the generated PDF in the browser.
- Change DPI before exporting.
- Open the generated PDF in a new tab.
- Download the generated PDF.
- No Python install required.

## Local Python dashboard

The local dashboard is the full desktop version. Use this when you want folder batch conversion, recursive subfolder scanning, or a Windows desktop preview workflow.

The launcher uses `c4_pdf_dashboard_mil.py`, which keeps the original `c4_pdf_dashboard.py` release code intact and adds `.MIL` support for JEDMICS CCITT4 files saved with a MIL extension.

## Features

- Select a single C4/MIL drawing or normal image file.
- Preview the decoded drawing on the right side with scroll and zoom.
- Save the selected drawing as a PDF.
- Batch convert a whole directory tree.
- Recursive batch mode searches all subfolders and writes each PDF beside the source file.
- Existing PDFs are skipped by default unless overwrite is enabled.

## Supported input formats

Direct conversion:

- `.C4` / `.c4` JEDMICS tiled CCITT Group 4 drawings
- `.MIL` / `.mil` JEDMICS CCITT4 drawings saved with a MIL extension
- `.tif` / `.tiff`
- `.png`
- `.jpg` / `.jpeg`
- `.bmp`
- `.gif`
- `.webp`
- `.pbm` / `.pgm` / `.ppm`

PDF preview is optional if `pymupdf` is installed. PDF files are not batch converted because they are already PDFs.

## Install

```bat
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Optional PDF preview support:

```bat
py -m pip install pymupdf
```

## Run

```bat
py c4_pdf_dashboard_mil.py
```

Or double click:

```text
run_c4_pdf_dashboard.bat
```

## Batch convert a folder tree

1. Open the dashboard.
2. Click **Batch convert folder...**.
3. Pick the top folder.
4. The program searches all subfolders for supported files.
5. It writes each output PDF in the same folder as the source file.

To replace existing PDFs, check **Overwrite PDFs in batch** before starting batch conversion.

## C4/MIL decoding notes

This tool decodes the common JEDMICS/C4 layout used by tiled black and white engineering raster drawings. Some JEDMICS exports store the same C4/CCITT4 data with a `.MIL` extension, so this tool treats `.C4` and `.MIL` as the same drawing data layout.

- 512 x 512 tiles
- CCITT Group 4 compression
- Little endian tile index sizes
- Drawing scale defaults to 200 DPI

The DPI value can be changed in the dashboard before saving or batch converting.
